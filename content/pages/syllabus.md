Through The Lens: Exploring The Department Of Brain And Cognitive Sciences
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This course provides practical instruction in fundamentals of analog and digital SLR and medium/large format camera operation, film exposure and development, black and white darkroom techniques, digital imaging, and studio lighting.

This semester we will explore the MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences for our theme- and site-specific term project, which provides opportunities to develop technical skills and experimental photographic techniques, and for personal artistic exploration. Final projects will be presented on site in exhibition format.

Work in progress is continuously presented and discussed in a critical forum. Lectures, readings, visiting professionals, group discussions, and site visits encourage aesthetic appreciation of the medium, as well as a critical awareness of how images in our culture are produced and constructed.

The following proposal was submitted to the MIT Council for the Arts, and may also be of interest ({{% resource_link 62c87a75-6ee5-3b0b-316f-cd708e27010c "PDF" %}}).
