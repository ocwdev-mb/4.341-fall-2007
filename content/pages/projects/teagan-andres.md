_Deconstructing Perfection_

I began my project by attempting to shoot images of perspective or planar views in such a way that distorted one's normal viewpoint. After trying different experimental methods, I decided that overlaying negatives was the best way to achieve the discomforting effect on a viewer that I was trying to capture. My intent was to cause people to question the image in front of them and how it related to the world with which they are familiar. How do we react to the visual construction of plane and perspective? Can an image of something we see everyday cause internal disturbance simply by changing our viewpoint?
