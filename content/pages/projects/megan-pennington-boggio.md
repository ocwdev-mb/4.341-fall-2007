description: Reality?  What is reality? How do we tell the difference between what

  It is this uncertainty that I hope to foster with my project.

_Reality_

What is reality? How do we tell the difference between what is real and what is an illusion? I want to explore how we feel when we think something is real and then discover that it was not reality as we thought it was? I want to contradict the general assumption that photographs are strictly real, or that they show reality exactly as it is. These pictures are designed to confuse the brain, to show something in such a way that we first perceive it as one thing, and then discover that it is in fact not exactly as we thought it was. It is my hope that as people walk through the BCS building, they will first see my photos and assume that they are all real, but eventually they will stop to read the project description and once they do, they'll begin to wonder about the actual content of all the images. It is this uncertainty that I hope to foster with my project.
