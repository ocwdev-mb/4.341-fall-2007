**Gavin Lund**

In my personal life, I tend toward individual activities that allow me to escape and think for a while. I also find myself quite often in natural settings, which can be very conducive to thought and meditation. This project encourages reflection by immersing the viewer in the isolation of nature. The contrast, the lines in the trees, and the patterns in the grass are meant to absorb the viewer's attention, and in contemplating these forms, have the same relaxing, thought-promoting effect as nature itself.
