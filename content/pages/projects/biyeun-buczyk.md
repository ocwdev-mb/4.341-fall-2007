**Biyeun Buczyk** 

_Body_ 

These images focus on how we interpolate a body (especially a human body) into images that we see, even if a body is not present.

_Memory_

I remember most events in my life as clear, colorful photographs. However, faces by themselves blend in and out of darkness, merely offering an outline or a sketch â€“ never quite the whole person. Even more obscure are memories from a specific period in my childhood, age four to seven, which interrupt an otherwise continuous montage of my life. During that time my family had moved to Khabarovsk, Russia, where, from what my parents told me, I fell unpleasantly sick very often. I vividly recall the day my family left Russia for good, and I vowed never to speak another word of Russian, which I had spoken fluently until that moment.

These images feature both recent self portraits and photos from the period of my childhood of which I have no memory.
